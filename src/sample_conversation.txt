>>> why is your name is bing
Because I was short for Big Al.

>>> wht is your mother name
Well, it’s a difficult one. Some people might say it’s easier to be big or small. But actually, it’s just another

>>> hello do you like camel
No thanks guys. I prefer smaller pets.

>>> smaller like monica
Yes, but also smaller like... you know, Joey.

>>> well joey is your friend right
Well yes, he’s very jolly.

>>> do you like coffee
Not as much fun as... you know... Mickey.

>>> who is mickey
Mick! Pick up the phone!

>>> well you need to do better
You can’t do that, Joey! It’s a pretty big task.

>>> what do you think about love
Not as much fun as... you know, dancing with a spoon.

>>> can i dance with you
Yes-yes, but I find it difficult to express my feelings in words. In person, you are very... well, hip.
